public class Final {

    /*
    Final Class: If a class is declared as final,
     it cannot be subclassed or extended by other classes.
     This is often done to prevent any further modification or extension of a class.

     final class FinalClass {
    // Class implementation
        }

    Final Method: When a method is marked as final,
     it cannot be overridden by subclasses.
      This means that the method's implementation in the superclass is the final and definitive version, and subclasses cannot change it.

      class BaseClass {
    final void finalMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}

    Final Variable: When a variable is declared as final,
     its value cannot be changed after it has been assigned a value.
      This is particularly useful when you want to create constants in your code.

      class Constants {
    final double PI = 3.14159;
    // Other constant declarations
}
